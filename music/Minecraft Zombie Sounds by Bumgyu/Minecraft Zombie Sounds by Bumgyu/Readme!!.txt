Minecraft sounds made easy to download by NerdyNoobGamer (Bumgyu)

All files are available in:
Ogg Vorbis Files (.ogg)
MP3 Files (.mp3)
WAVE Files (.wav)

The sounds inside the door folder are the sounds you hear when a zombie
tries to break the door. You should have watched the entire video if you are
confused about what the files are.

I didn't make Minecraft or the zombie sounds in Minecraft. You can actually get these files
yourself from the %appdata%\.minecraft folder. I made this because the files are in .ogg format,
which the windows media player CANNOT open. Plus, these files are kind of hard to find
if you never ran minecraft version older than 1.7.2

I am not trying to be mean to the "makers" of these sound effects. I am just trying to help
people get these files for their Minecraft animations or whatever. I am not liable to any harm
these files do to your computer (I mean, what can those files do? Explode your computer
because of extreme awesomeness? I don't think so). Or yourself (Creeper... I mean zombie alert!!)
